## Project Overview

This project aims to create websites that are accessible and usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Inclusive web design incorporates accessibility best practices, ensuring that websites are perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for users with diverse needs, including those who use assistive technologies like screen readers, voice recognition software, or specialized input devices.

This project aims to empower developers to implement features and structures that adhere to accessibility standards (such as WCAG), making digital content inclusive for all users.

## Criteria of Success

1. Delivering a website that is the first point of contact for people who would like to gain a practical framework and features for accessible websites.
2. Delivering the project on time (on or before the 18th of November 2024).
3. Website users would find it easy to navigate and utilize.
4. Raising the awareness that not only building accessible websites is essential but easy to achieve using the current website.

# User Goal

### As a visually impaired user, I benefit from the high contrast mode and larger text options, making the site easier to read.

- The "Accessibility Features" dropdown menu allows me to toggle these options without any hassle.
- I can also switch to the OpenDyslexic font, reducing visual stress while reading the content.
  
### As a user with color blindness, I appreciate the built-in colorblind modes like deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia filters.

- I can see and differentiate the content, images, and icons by selecting the appropriate filter.
- As someone who relies on voice commands, I can easily enable the Voice Control feature.
- This allows me to navigate the site hands-free, making it convenient for individuals with mobility impairments.
  
### As a user exploring the site for resources, I find the navigation menu intuitive and straightforward.

- The links to the "Resources," "About," and "Contact" pages are visible and accessible.
- The "Skip to main content" link at the top ensures that I can bypass repetitive navigation and quickly access the core content.
  
### As a person who values inclusive design, I am delighted to see the comprehensive range of accessibility options.

- I can customize the theme (light, dark, high contrast) and font themes to suit my preferences, making my browsing experience more comfortable.
  
### As a user looking for help, the Contact page is easy to find.

- I can fill out a simple form, providing my name, email, and message, and expect a prompt response from the team.
- The site's address and contact information are also clearly listed, offering multiple ways to get in touch.
  
### As a user interested in learning about accessibility, I can navigate to the "Accessibility Guide".

- This page offers helpful tips and information on using the website's features effectively, demonstrating the project’s commitment to inclusivity.
